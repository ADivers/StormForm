# StormForm

<h1>Event Planner</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

An event planner web application that allows users of a company to brainstorm and vote on ideas, events, and venues. Then, the highest voted events will be sent to users with the profiles of HR and Finance to be approved or not aproved. If approved, the event planning committee will be notitfied and they will continue the process on their own. If not, the idea will be sent back to the voting stage. 

We will integrate StormForm with our previous project, a CRM tool that sends out emails and text messages.

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

A component where any pictures taken at the event will be stored for future use.
